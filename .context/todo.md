# Codejitsu TODO

> Living implementation checklist. `.context/` records architectural intent; code and tests are authoritative for what is actually implemented.

> Updated: 2026-08-25

## Current Position

The Context Scroll / canonical resource graph slice is complete and merged into `main`. The repository now has the initial package workspace under `packages/` and the current architectural direction is recorded in `.context/architecture/`, `.context/decisions/`, `.context/current-state.ctx`, and `.context/roadmap/current.md`.

The old root `todo.md` was stale: several items described pre-graph architecture and conflicted with the current `ScrollCodex`/resource model. Those items are intentionally replaced by the checklist below rather than carried forward as zombie TODOs.

## MVP Goal

Finish Codejitsu as a small, package-oriented POC with:

- a clean package workspace/monorepo boundary
- `ScrollCodex` as the single discovery/index/resolution boundary
- source-aware URI resolution and lightweight metadata queries
- first-class resource references/graph behavior
- a complete Scroll-driven CLI
- package management exposed through Command Scrolls
- a green behavioral test suite
- no required OpenSwoole dependency
- a clean boundary so `shinobiphp/shinobi` can begin as the next repository/runtime layer

## 1. Package Workspace

Current packages present:

- [x] `packages/core`
- [x] `packages/discovery`
- [x] `packages/scrolls`
- [x] `packages/codex`
- [x] `packages/config`
- [x] `packages/schema`
- [x] `packages/console`

Remaining:

- [ ] Verify each package has the correct Composer metadata and dependency direction.
- [ ] Map remaining root `src/` ownership explicitly before moving code.
- [ ] Move/mirror independently meaningful code into package boundaries without breaking the public `Codejitsu\\` namespace where practical.
- [ ] Make the root package the development/compatibility aggregate rather than a second architectural layer.
- [ ] Verify clean Composer installation and package autoloading.
- [ ] Do not create empty packages merely for symmetry; Crypto, DB, AI, OpenSwoole, and future agent concepts remain root/MVP concerns until their contracts are proven.

## 2. Codejitsu Runtime Boundary

- [ ] Remove `openswoole/core` from Codejitsu's required dependency graph.
- [ ] Remove or relocate genuinely OpenSwoole-specific runtime behavior from the Codejitsu MVP path.
- [ ] Add a regression test proving Codejitsu CLI/bootstrap works without OpenSwoole.
- [ ] Keep long-running runtime/orchestration concerns for Shinobi.

## 3. Codex Discovery, Index & Cache

`ScrollCodex` is the single discovery/index/resolution boundary.

- [ ] Make complete Scroll discovery Codex-owned.
- [ ] Discover every supported Scroll type from configured roots.
- [ ] Register every discovery origin as a named source.
- [ ] Introduce/finish lightweight `IndexEntry` metadata separate from hydrated Scroll instances.
- [ ] Query by type, name, version, tags, attributes, source, and URI/path without hydration.
- [ ] Preserve source provenance in indexed metadata.
- [ ] Add persistent cache/index storage.
- [ ] Validate cache freshness with a manifest/fingerprint.
- [ ] Add explicit cache rebuild/clear operations.
- [ ] Expose cache operations through Command Scrolls.
- [ ] Add behavioral tests proving metadata queries do not hydrate candidates.

## 4. Source-Aware URI Resolution

Logical resource identity is independent of physical source layout.

- [x] `@source` selectors are part of URI resolution, not logical identity.
- [x] Explicit source cascades are left-to-right.
- [x] Implicit resolution uses reverse registration order.
- [x] Preserve source provenance.
- [ ] Finish/verify the Codex-owned implementation and integration tests.

Examples:

```text
register @global
register @tenant

config://app
  -> @tenant -> @global

config://app@tenant.global
  -> @tenant -> @global

config://app@global.tenant
  -> @global -> @tenant
```

## 5. Resource Graph & References

- [x] Canonical Scroll representation is a semantic resource graph rather than a codec-specific array or compiler AST.
- [x] Named references normalize into graph relationships.
- [x] References are resolved lazily through the Codex.
- [ ] Make dependency/reference inspection sufficiently first-class for dependent resources to be inspected before execution.
- [ ] Add resource relationship queries where required by a concrete vertical slice.
- [ ] Preserve provenance through graph/index operations.

Example:

```text
cmd://hello
  ├── schema://hello
  └── capability://hello
```

## 6. Context Scrolls

`.context/` is intended to become a first-class Scroll source rather than a pile of Markdown agents have to rediscover manually.

- [ ] Establish/finish `.ctx` discovery and indexing as a normal Codex source.
- [ ] Support Markdown payloads inside Context Scrolls.
- [ ] Make context queryable by logical URI, metadata, source, and relationship.
- [ ] Preserve human-readable Markdown while making metadata machine-discoverable.
- [ ] Avoid a destructive bulk conversion of existing `.md` context files; migrate deliberately.
- [ ] Prove a consumer can request targeted context without loading the entire repository.

## 7. CLI / Command Scrolls

Target flow:

```text
argv
  -> CliIntent
  -> ScrollCodex
  -> Command Scroll
  -> Schema
  -> Capability
  -> execution
```

- [ ] Discover and list Command Scrolls through the Codex.
- [ ] Resolve commands by canonical colon-separated names such as `scrolls:cache:rebuild`.
- [ ] Execute commands through the same Scroll/Codex path; do not introduce a second command framework.
- [ ] Generate namespace help/listing from command metadata without hydrating every child.
- [ ] Make `bin/codejitsu` exercise the real path end-to-end.
- [ ] Add behavioral CLI integration coverage.

## 8. Package Management

Add a minimal package-management abstraction as composition over Composer, not as a replacement dependency solver.

- [ ] Create the package-management boundary only after the core package workspace is stable.
- [ ] Define minimal package metadata/manifest contracts.
- [ ] Implement package discovery/list/info.
- [ ] Implement install/remove/update through an explicit Composer boundary.
- [ ] Produce structured, traceable results and propagate failures cleanly.
- [ ] Add disposable-fixture tests.

Expose through Command Scrolls:

- [ ] `pkg:list`
- [ ] `pkg:info`
- [ ] `pkg:install`
- [ ] `pkg:remove`
- [ ] `pkg:update`

Each command should use the existing Schema + Capability + Command Scroll execution path.

## 9. Contracts & Serialization

These are not the old pre-graph TODOs; only pursue them where the current implementation or a concrete vertical slice requires them.

- [ ] Formalize Scroll identity as a value object where the current code does not already provide the needed boundary.
- [ ] Strengthen Envelope/Scroll serialization contracts.
- [ ] Keep codecs replaceable: NEON, `.ctx`, JSON/YAML, and future formats converge on the canonical resource model.
- [ ] Keep discovery separate from hydration and execution.
- [ ] Remove genuinely deprecated pre-graph Codice/store/per-type registry structures if any remain in the active implementation.
- [ ] Add signed/traceable resource provenance only when it belongs to the proven Codejitsu boundary; cryptographic provenance is post-MVP unless required earlier.

## 10. Documentation / Context Integrity

- [ ] Keep `.context/current-state.ctx` synchronized with the actual repository baseline.
- [ ] Keep `.context/roadmap/current.md` synchronized with implemented vs planned work.
- [ ] Update architecture docs when package boundaries or resource contracts become locked.
- [ ] Add an ADR documenting the MVP package workspace/monorepo boundary and why not every subsystem is extracted yet.
- [ ] Update glossary only with terminology that has become a stable Codejitsu concept.
- [ ] Treat `.context/` as architectural/project memory, not as a substitute for tests or code.

## 11. MVP Verification

Before declaring Codejitsu MVP complete:

- [ ] Clean Composer install succeeds without OpenSwoole.
- [ ] Selected packages install and autoload correctly.
- [ ] Scroll discovery/index/source-aware resolution/references work through `ScrollCodex`.
- [ ] Metadata queries do not require hydration of every candidate.
- [ ] Command Scrolls drive the CLI end-to-end.
- [ ] Namespace help/listing comes from discovered command metadata.
- [ ] All `pkg:*` commands execute through the same Command Scroll path.
- [ ] Full PHPUnit suite is green.
- [ ] CLI smoke test is green.
- [ ] `.context/` clearly distinguishes implemented Codejitsu behavior from future Shinobi/Sensei/Vessel/Spark work.
- [ ] A clean Codejitsu checkout can serve as the dependency foundation for `shinobiphp/shinobi`.

## Explicitly Post-MVP

Do **not** block Codejitsu MVP on:

- Spark/agent abstractions
- Vessel implementation
- Sensei TUI or code-generation workflows
- model/provider integrations
- OpenSwoole long-running runtime
- async event/outbox/retry/compensation infrastructure
- distributed/service-node resolution
- MCP integration
- ArchIQ integration
- semantic/vector search
- cryptographically signed resource provenance

These belong to the later Shinobi/agentic roadmap unless a concrete Codejitsu requirement moves one back into scope.
