# 0001 — Scrolls Are First-Class Resources

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Codejitsu needs a common model for configuration, schemas, capabilities, commands, workflows, skills, and future resource types without creating unrelated one-off loading and execution systems.

## Decision

Model these resources as first-class Scrolls with shared identity, addressing, metadata, hydration, discovery, and optional invocation semantics.

Scroll type-specific behavior belongs in specialized Scroll classes, while the base Scroll remains a common behavioral contract.

## Consequences

Resources can be discovered, indexed, resolved, referenced, versioned, validated, and executed through a common substrate.

The design also creates a path toward non-PHP resource consumers and future distributed/federated resource resolution.
