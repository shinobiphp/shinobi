# References and Execution

References connect declarative Scrolls without forcing compile-time object graphs.

## Reference Flow

```text
scroll attribute
   ↓
URI string
   ↓
Scroll::ref()
   ↓
ScrollCodex::resolve()
   ↓
resolved Scroll
   ↓
invoke / consume
```

A Command can reference a Schema for input validation and a Capability for execution.

## Execution Semantics

A Scroll may be executable when its type exposes executable behavior. Execution should remain explicit and observable.

References should resolve through the owning Codex rather than directly constructing another resource. This preserves versioning, addressing, tenancy, and future federation boundaries.

## Command Composition

Command Scrolls can compose behavior from other Scrolls:

```text
Command
  ├── Schema
  │    └── validates payload
  └── Capability
       └── performs behavior
```

Namespace commands add another layer:

```text
cmd://scrolls
  ├── scrolls:hello
  ├── scrolls:cache
  └── scrolls:cache:rebuild
```

The parent stores child definitions as data. Child hydration is deferred until execution.

## Principle

References should be declarative, addressable, replaceable, and version-aware. Avoid embedding concrete implementation objects when a stable Scroll URI can express the dependency.
