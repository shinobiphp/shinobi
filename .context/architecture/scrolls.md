# Scroll Architecture

A Scroll is a first-class, discoverable, addressable resource.

## Core Contract

Every Scroll has a type, name, version, tags, attributes/data, and optional Envelope/Codex binding. The base class supports hydration, serialization, references, and invocation when the specialized Scroll exposes executable behavior. fileciteturn102file0L2-L2

The current identity key used by `ScrollCodex` is:

```text
<type>:<name>#<version>
```

For example:

```text
command:hello#1.0.0
schema:hello#1.0.0
capability:hello#1.0.0
```

URIs are the external addressing mechanism:

```text
cmd://hello
schema://hello
capability://hello
config://shinobi
```

A version fragment may constrain resolution, while omission means the current/latest matching resource. The URI model also has tenant and target concepts reserved for contextual/distributed resolution. fileciteturn107file0L2-L2

## Hydration

Discovery should be able to identify a Scroll without executing it. Hydration turns a discovered/serialized representation into a concrete Scroll instance.

The Envelope is the serialized/resource boundary; the Scroll is the behavioral object.

## References

A Scroll may reference another Scroll by URI. The reference is resolved through the bound `ScrollCodex`:

```text
Command
  ├── schema://hello
  └── capability://hello
```

This deliberately keeps references addressable rather than embedding arbitrary object graphs.

## Command Scrolls

Command Scrolls provide CLI-oriented metadata such as description, usage, schema, capability, target, and optional child command definitions.

A namespace command keeps child definitions in its serialized data so help/list operations can inspect them without hydrating child Commands. Child commands are exposed canonically with colon-separated names:

```text
scrolls
scrolls:cache
scrolls:cache:rebuild
```

The parent namespace is the owner of the raw child definitions; runtime child hydration happens only when execution requires it.

## Polyglot Direction

The resource model is intentionally format-neutral at the domain level. NEON is the current storage representation, but Scroll semantics should not depend on PHP-specific implementation details. Future runtimes may consume equivalent Scroll resources in other languages or execution substrates.
